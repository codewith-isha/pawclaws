          Happy new year. It is that time of the year where we talk about;
          dreams, hope and aspirations. Over last five years I have been doing
          an exercise which gave me everything (literally) I wished for. I
          create — <span class="font-semibold">Vision Board.</span>

          What is a vision board?
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          I created my first vision board in 2013.A year after my first Multiple
          Sclerosis (MS) episode. My focus was my body and feeling good about
          it. In March, My MRI reports revealed that the lesions responsible for
          initial episodes were silent. I made a choice and took up projects and
          assignments as a freelance corporate trainer rather than working full
          time. I was well compensated as I would in my full-time job. In fact,
          in couple of assignments I made more.

        <p class="mb-4">
          2014: My vision board had all the material things. I have manifested
          much better furniture in my house whose pics I had on my vision board.
          I did
          <span class="font-semibold">Heal your life® teacher training</span> in
          Sep. 2014. Which was also my vision. See below my vision board and the
          certificate of completion of my training.

          Best time to create a vision board
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Though the best time to create a vision board would be the beginning
          of the year. As it can set the tone for the year. Last year, I felt so
          pressurized by the time line that I let it go completely and created
          it in middle of the year. I almost achieved everything pasted on the
          board except for two areas. And on those areas, I have made reasonable
          progress.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Often every want stems from day dreaming about it. Dreaming about what
          you would like to experience in your life is a great way to lead a
          meaningful life. End of the year, winter, winter solstice is a
          wonderful time for hibernation, reflection and contemplation. I mean,
          look around us, all the elements of nature do the same. Trees shed
          their leaves, mountains clad snow and animals hide in the lap of
          mother earth. Why do we act differently then? Winter holidays can be
          uplifting. It lets our mind-body relax and refuels for the glorious
          productive days to come. This is the best time of the year to day
          dream.
        </p>

          Preparation for vision board
        </h3>
        <p class="font-semibold text-lg mb-4">Don’t just dream it, goal it.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          First and foremost- decide! What you would like to achieve by the end
          of coming year. In terms of your various goals in different areas of
          your life. Like- Health, finances, family, career, relationships,
          travel, spiritual growth etc.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          You can describe things in terms of feelings like, “I would like to be
          happy and peaceful” than specific goals like a certain brand of car.
          Yes, this can be added in your vision board too.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Material, emotional and spiritual goals are all welcome on the vision
          board. Though the outcome might differ. In my experience it is usually
          better than expected.
        </p>

          Creating a vision board
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          It is so much fun and better than just an old to-do list. We live in a
          digital world. Buying magazines have increasingly become an old fad. I
          suggest, go to a well-developed magazine section of a bookstore. Flip
          through the specific ones that match your goals. Do not get caught up
          in fancy ads and articles. The idea is to collect pictures which can
          motivate you to stay on top of your goals.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Remember to select pictures which speak to you, describe your
          aspiration, inspire you and excite you. Let go off comparisons and
          ‘should’. You can get a poster board or a simple drawing sheet to
          paste all the pictures.
        </p>

          Releasing your Vision

        <p class="mb-4">
          After you have pasted the pictures we suggest ‘charging’ your vision.
          We do a high impact meditation to release the vision.

          Our visual memory is the strongest. When we watch movies, we tend to
          believe what we see. Seeing your goals in form of a colored image can
          activate your sub-conscious to take actions in those areas. If you
          cannot achieve it in one year break it and spread over a span of few
          years. Do not overwhelm yourself with the timelines. After all it is
          your dream and your goal to achieve. You are free to change it, flex
          it and flow with it.

          As Louise said in her interview to Oprah that a vision board can be a
          very effective tool-
          <span class="italic"
            >“It can help you to focus on what you want, when you do that, it’s
            like the universe giving you ideas (how to get there)”</span
          >
        </p>
        <p class="mb-8">
          The bottom line is to have lot of fun while doing it. It works well
          when you can do it in a group. I’m holding such a wonderful workshop
          with six limited seats on 21st of January 2018.
